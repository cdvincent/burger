<h2>Eat-Da-Burger!</h2>

<p>Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.</p>

<p>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.</p>

<p>Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.</p>

<p>All burgers will be stored in an MySQL database.</p>

<p>Eat-Da-Burger uses a homemade ORM and uses the express, express-handlebars, and mysql npm's as dependencies. Express is used for the routing, handlebars is used for the back-end to display html, and mysql is used to communicate with the MySQL database.</p>
